Project for CNN-based diver following:

>> This project contain code for diver detection and publishing the target bounding box
  > the target bounding box is used by yaw_pitch_controller for generating actual commands 
    for following the diver (see target detection project, bbox_yaw_pitch_controller.py)

>> The diver_following_cnn folder contain the ROS-package version 
   > currently running on the Aqua MinneBot robot
